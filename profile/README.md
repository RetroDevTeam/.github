## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

We like to make retro type games, but not always. Hopefully in the futures we can make VR games ðŸ¤ž

You can get involved by fixing some bug fixes or pointing them out. Or you could just download our stuff. _(when they come out)_

At [our website](retrodevteam.github.io/index) you can find alot of docs. _(when we make it)_

We eat cereal.

- [x] Make readme.md
- [ ] Make first app
